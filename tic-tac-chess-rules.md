Be the first to align your four pieces of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Play starts on an empty board, players take turns placing a piece on an empty square. After placing your first three pieces you may move and capture as in regular chess, except a pawn reverses direction upon reaching the opposite side of the board. Captured pieces are returned to their owner and can immediately be played again on any open square.
